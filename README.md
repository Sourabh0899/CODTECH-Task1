# Overview of the Project

# Project: Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) on Titanic Dataset

# Objectives:
Perform data cleaning and preprocessing (handle missing data, categorical variables, etc.).
Analyze key features such as age, gender, passenger class, fare, and their impact on survival.
Visualize data trends using plots and charts (e.g., survival rates by class, age distribution, etc.).
Identify correlations between variables to determine which factors most influenced passenger survival.

# Tools and Techniques:
Python: For data manipulation and analysis.
Pandas: Data loading, cleaning, and processing.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: Data visualization.
NumPy: Numerical operations.

# Key Findings:
Gender and passenger class were strong predictors of survival.
Passengers in higher classes had higher survival rates compared to lower classes.
Females had a significantly higher survival rate than males.
